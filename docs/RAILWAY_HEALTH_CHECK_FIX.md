# Railway Health Check Fix

## Problem
Railway health check was failing with "service unavailable" errors even though the build was successful.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **Incorrect start command**: Using `npm start` instead of `node server.js` for standalone builds
2. **PORT environment variable**: Not properly using Railway's dynamic PORT assignment
3. **Docker configuration**: Hard-coded PORT instead of using Railway's provided PORT

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated Start Command
Changed from `npm start` to `node server.js` in all Railway configurations:
- `railway.json`
- `railway.basic.json` 
- `railway.advanced.json`

**Reason**: With Next.js `output: 'standalone'`, the build creates a `server.js` file that should be run directly, not through npm scripts.

### 2. Fixed Docker PORT Configuration
Updated `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
# Before
ENV PORT 3000

# After  
ENV PORT ${PORT:-3000}
```

**Reason**: Railway provides a dynamic PORT environment variable that the container must use.

### 3. Enhanced Health Endpoint
Added debugging information to `/api/health`:
```typescript
{
  status: 'healthy',
  timestamp: '2025-06-28T06:55:35.580Z',
  environment: 'production',
  apiKeyMode: 'personal-only',
  port: process.env.PORT || '3000',
  hostname: process.env.HOSTNAME || 'localhost', 
  nodeEnv: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  services: {
    api: 'operational',
    settings: 'operational'
  }
}
```

**Reason**: Provides visibility into environment configuration for debugging.

## Testing
1. **Local standalone test**: âœ… Working
2. **Health endpoint**: âœ… Responding correctly
3. **Docker build**: âœ… Builds successfully
4. **Railway deployment**: ðŸ”„ Ready for testing

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Railway with the updated configuration
2. Monitor health check logs to verify the fix
3. If still failing, check Railway deployment logs for port binding issues

## Configuration Files Updated
- âœ… `Dockerfile` - Dynamic PORT configuration
- âœ… `railway.json` - Start command updated
- âœ… `railway.basic.json` - Start command updated  
- âœ… `railway.advanced.json` - Start command updated
- âœ… `src/app/api/health/route.ts` - Enhanced debugging info

## Key Learnings
- Next.js standalone builds require direct `node server.js` execution
- Railway provides dynamic PORT that must be respected
- Health check endpoints should include environment debugging info
- Docker ENV vars should use Railway's provided values, not hard-coded ones
