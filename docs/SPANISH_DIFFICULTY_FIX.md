# Production Bug Fix: Spanish Difficulty Values in Recipe Schema

## Issue Summary

The application was failing in production when Spanish users uploaded fridge photos. The error occurred because Claude AI was responding with Spanish difficulty values ("Fácil", "Medio", "Difícil") but the Zod validation schema only accepted English values ("Easy", "Medium", "Hard").

## Error Details

```
Failed to parse Claude response: Error [ZodError]: [
  {
    "received": "Fácil",
    "code": "invalid_enum_value",
    "options": ["Easy", "Medium", "Hard"],
    "path": ["difficulty"],
    "message": "Invalid enum value. Expected 'Easy' | 'Medium' | 'Hard', received 'Fácil'"
  }
]
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Spanish Prompt Template**: The Spanish prompt was instructing Claude to use Spanish difficulty values: `"difficulty": "Fácil|Medio|Difícil"`
2. **English-only Schema**: The Zod schema (`RecipeSchema`) only accepted English enum values: `['Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard']`
3. **No Translation Layer**: There was no mechanism to translate Spanish responses back to English before validation

## Solution Applied

Modified the Spanish prompt template in `/src/app/api/analyze-fridge/route.ts` to:

1. **Use English difficulty values**: Changed `"Fácil|Medio|Difícil"` to `"Easy|Medium|Hard"` in the Spanish prompt
2. **Added explicit instruction**: Added a requirement in Spanish: "IMPORTANTE: El campo 'difficulty' debe ser exactamente 'Easy', 'Medium' o 'Hard' en inglés"
3. **Maintained language consistency**: Kept all other content in Spanish while ensuring schema compatibility

## Files Modified

- `/src/app/api/analyze-fridge/route.ts` (lines ~117 and ~139)

## Testing

- ✅ Created unit tests to verify the fix works
- ✅ Verified build compilation succeeds
- ✅ Tested prompt generation with validation script
- ✅ Confirmed Spanish prompt now uses English difficulty values

## Impact

- **Fixes production crashes** for Spanish users
- **Maintains user experience** in Spanish while ensuring backend compatibility
- **No breaking changes** for existing English users
- **Scalable approach** that can be applied to other enum fields if needed

## Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Bilingual schema**: Make Zod accept both languages (rejected - adds complexity)
2. **Translation layer**: Add post-processing to translate Spanish→English (rejected - more overhead)
3. **Current solution**: Modify prompts to use English for structured fields (chosen - clean and simple)

## Verification

The fix ensures that Spanish users can now use the fridge analysis feature without encountering validation errors, while maintaining the localized Spanish content in the recipe descriptions, instructions, and tips.
