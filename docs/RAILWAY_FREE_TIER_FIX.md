# Railway Free Tier Configuration Fix

## ðŸš¨ **Issue Resolved**

Railway was showing the error:

> "Your plan can only deploy to a single region. Please upgrade to Pro to deploy to multiple regions."

## âœ… **Solution Applied**

### **Problem Identification**

The `railway.json` was accidentally using the advanced configuration with multi-region deployment settings that require a Railway Pro plan.

### **Configuration Fixed**

1. **Removed Multi-Region Settings**:

   - Removed all `multiRegionConfig` blocks
   - Removed `numReplicas` settings
   - Removed advanced Nixpacks configuration
   - Removed pre-deploy commands

2. **Created Proper Templates**:
   - `railway.basic.json` - Free tier compatible
   - `railway.advanced.json` - Pro tier features
   - Updated helper script to use correct templates

### **Current Configuration (Basic)**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.com/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm run build",
    "watchPatterns": [
      /* optimized patterns */
    ]
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 60,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 3,
    "overlapSeconds": 30,
    "drainingSeconds": 15
  },
  "environments": {
    "production": {
      /* single-region settings */
    },
    "staging": {
      /* single-region settings */
    },
    "development": {
      /* dev settings */
    },
    "pr": {
      /* PR settings */
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Free Tier Features Included**

- âœ… Health checks (/api/health)
- âœ… Zero-downtime deployment (30s overlap)
- âœ… Environment-specific settings
- âœ… Smart watch patterns
- âœ… Restart policies
- âœ… Single-region deployment
- ðŸš« No multi-region (Pro tier only)
- ðŸš« No custom Nixpacks (simplified)
- ðŸš« No pre-deploy commands

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Deployment**

### **Commands Available**

```bash
npm run railway:list      # Show available configurations
npm run railway:check     # Analyze current setup
npm run railway:basic     # Switch to free tier config
npm run railway:advanced  # Switch to Pro tier config (requires upgrade)
```

### **Deploy to Railway**

```bash
railway up
```

The configuration is now compatible with Railway's free tier and should deploy without requiring an upgrade to Pro.

## ðŸ“‹ **File Structure**

```
â”œâ”€â”€ railway.json           # Current active config (basic)
â”œâ”€â”€ railway.basic.json     # Free tier template
â”œâ”€â”€ railway.advanced.json  # Pro tier template (multi-region)
â””â”€â”€ railway-helper.mjs     # Configuration management tool
```

## âœ… **Verification**

- [x] No `multiRegionConfig` in railway.json
- [x] No `numReplicas` settings
- [x] Health checks configured
- [x] Zero-downtime deployment enabled
- [x] Environment-specific overrides working
