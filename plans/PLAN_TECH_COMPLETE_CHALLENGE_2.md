## üåç Phase 4: Polish & Production Readiness

This final phase is about refining the user experience, ensuring robustness through i18n and documentation, and preparing for deployment.

### ‚úÖ **Track 9: Internationalization (i18n) Deep Dive**

- [ ] **Component Migration:**
  - [ ] Internationalize `RecipeDisplay` (section headers, buttons, etc.).
  - [ ] Remove all hardcoded strings from all UI components.
- [ ] **i18n Testing & Validation:**
  - [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of user flows with translations.
  - [ ] Analyze bundle size to ensure it remains under the 5% increase target.
  - [ ] Measure runtime performance to detect regressions.
- [ ] **Advanced i18n:**
  - [ ] Create validation scripts to ensure translation completeness.
  - [ ] Implement Spanish market readiness features.
  - [ ] Set up monitoring/analytics for language usage.

### ‚úÖ **Track 10: Documentation & Final Polish**
