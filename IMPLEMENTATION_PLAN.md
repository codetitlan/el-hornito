## 🚨 Risk Management

### Critical Risks (Must Address)

1. **Claude API Rate Limits**

   - _Risk:_ API limits could block development
   - _Mitigation:_ Implement local mock responses for development
   - _Status:_ 🟡 Monitoring

2. **Image Processing Performance**
   - _Risk:_ Large images could cause timeouts
   - _Mitigation:_ Implement client-side compression with sharp
   - _Status:_ 🟡 Monitoring

### Medium Risks (Monitor Closely)

3. **Next.js 15 + React 19 Compatibility**

   - _Risk:_ New versions might have breaking changes
   - _Mitigation:_ Test thoroughly, have fallback plan
   - _Status:_ 🟢 Low Risk

4. **Mobile Camera Integration**
   - _Risk:_ Camera access might not work on all devices
   - _Mitigation:_ Graceful degradation to file picker
   - _Status:_ 🟡 Monitoring
